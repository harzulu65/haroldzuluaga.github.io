# 01 HTML CSS Git: My First Website

This is my first a pproach to a personal website.

The task is to setup a menu bar and to create a profile/porfolio/contact information.

The tools used will be using Bootstrap to the htnl and css, all pages will be responsive.

I created three HTML files: Index.html, Portfolio.html, contact.html.

Index.html: Contains the Main menu with a brackground picture and three
columns, one per each section requested.

Portfolio.html: COntains the website/pages that will be stored in Github.
I made a link to the only repository created and left placeholders for the future links.
There is also a link to the main page in Github.

Contact.html: This page shows my personal information and a little bio.

The idea with this is to maintain it and make it better as my training progresses.
Pictures and content will change to improve looks and content and to make it more professional.

Great task to start the Coding Boot Camp @ UC Irvine.
